    "Description": "Hi, As a person whom respect the Internet, I would like to seek for your your permission. Is it acceptable for me to share Hockey video highlights from your site (http://www.hotstar.com/sports/hockey) on my Facebook page as per the link below? http://www.hotstar.com/sports/hockey I will *NOT* share the live stream, just the hockey video highlights and *credit it back to Hotstar*. My page is non profit and I would like to just promote hockey and have people to be able to watch hockey videos on Facebook. I hope this would be acceptable as the videos are not live and just highlights. Whatever your decision would be, I will respect it. I hope you will consider it first before making a decision. Regards, Hockey Telly.",
